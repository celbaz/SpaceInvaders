# Space Invaders

A javascript version of the classic 1970's arcade game. The objective is to shoot all the alien ships before the reach your side ( i.e. Earth ). After killing all the aliens in a level, they come back... this time even faster. Click the link above to try for yourself!

Javascript was used to create modular classes for the moving objects (i.e the invaders, you, and bullets), detect collisions, and reset the game. HTML5 Canvas was used to draw these objects at each set interval.
